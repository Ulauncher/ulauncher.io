description: Guide for migrating old theme format to the new simplified format
---

If you have an existing theme in the old manifest-based format, this guide will help you migrate it to the new simplified CSS-only format introduced in Ulauncher 6.0.0.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Identify the CSS File

In your theme directory, locate the main CSS file:
- If `manifest.json` defines `css_file_gtk_3.20`, that's your CSS file
- Otherwise, the `css_file` property points to your CSS file

### 2. Flatten CSS Imports

If your CSS file contains `@import` statements like:
```css
@import url("theme.css");
```

Replace the import statement with the actual content of the imported file.

### 3. Add Highlight Colors

Copy color values from `manifest.json` to your CSS file:

**From manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "matched_text_hl_colors": {
    "when_not_selected": "#ff7b57",
    "when_selected": "#ffcbbd"
  }
}
```

**To CSS file:**
```css
.item-highlight {
  color: #ff7b57;
}

.selected.item-box .item-highlight {
  color: #ffcbbd;
}
```

If both colors are the same, you only need the first rule.

### 4. Handle Extended Themes

If your `manifest.json` has `extend_theme` set to another theme:

1. Locate the parent theme
2. Copy all CSS from the parent theme to the top of your CSS file
3. Remove any duplicate selectors (keep your custom values)

### 5. Save as Plain CSS

1. Save the final CSS file with your theme name as the filename
2. Use `.css` extension
3. Place it in `~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes/`
4. Remove the old manifest-based theme directory if desired

## Example: Before and After

### Before (Old Format)

**Directory structure:**
```
~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes/my-theme/
├── manifest.json
└── theme.css
```

**manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "My Theme",
  "css_file": "theme.css",
  "matched_text_hl_colors": {
    "when_not_selected": "#ff7b57"
  }
}
```

**theme.css:**
```css
.input {
  background-color: #2d2d2d;
}
```

### After (New Format)

**File:**
```
~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes/My Theme.css
```

**My Theme.css:**
```css
.input {
  background-color: #2d2d2d;
}

.item-highlight {
  color: #ff7b57;
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

Both the old manifest-based format and the new CSS-only format are supported in Ulauncher 6.0.0+. You can choose to keep the old format if it works for your needs, but the new format is recommended for its simplicity.
