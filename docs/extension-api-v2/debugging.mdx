# Testing & Logging

## Testing an Extension

To test an extension, copy it to `~/.local/share/ulauncher/extensions/your-extension`

Then restart Ulauncher with the following command:

```bash
ulauncher --no-extensions --dev -v
```

When you need to restart your extension hit `Ctrl+C` and run the last command again.

## Set up Logger

Here's all you need to do to enable logging for your extension:

```python
import logging

# create an instance of logger at a module level
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# then use these methods in your classes or functions:
logger.error('...')
logger.warn('...')
logger.info('...')
logger.debug('...')
