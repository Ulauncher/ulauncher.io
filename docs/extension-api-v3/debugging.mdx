# Debugging & Logging

:::warning
You are looking at unfinished documentation for Extension API v3 which is still in development. For stable Extension API v2, please visit [Extension API v2](/extension-api-v2).
:::

## Development Workflow

1. Install your extension using the path to your local git repo rather than the public URL.
2. Commit your changes in the local repo.
3. Update the extension in Ulauncher's preferences to pull in the changes from your local repo.
4. To get verbose log output, stop Ulauncher and start it in a terminal `ulauncher -v`.
5. Once you are done with your changes, stop Ulauncher and start it normally again
6. Push your changes to your public remote (GitHub, GitLab or other) if you want to make them available to others.

## Set up Logger

Here's all you need to do to enable logging for your extension:

```python
import logging

# create an instance of logger at a module level
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# then use these methods in your classes or functions:
logger.error('...')
logger.warn('...')
logger.info('...')
logger.debug('...')
```

## Debugging Tips

- Use `ulauncher -v` to see detailed logs from your extension
- Add logging statements at key points in your code to trace execution
- Check the logs for any Python exceptions or errors
- Use `print()` statements as a quick debugging method (they will appear in the verbose output)
- Test your extension thoroughly before publishing
